University Library Management System: Project Documentation
This document serves as the comprehensive overview for a university library management system, developed as the final project for a Database Systems course. It encapsulates the core principles of database design, implementation, and administration using SQL and PL/SQL.

Project Vision & Achievements
This assignment was designed to showcase my proficiency in various database concepts, from foundational design to advanced programming and administration.

Core Objectives Achieved:
System Design: Successfully designed and implemented a robust database schema for a functional library system.

Relational Mastery: Applied normalization and relational database theory to ensure data integrity and efficiency.

Advanced Querying: Developed sophisticated SQL queries for data retrieval, manipulation, and analytical reporting.

Procedural Logic: Implemented PL/SQL procedures, functions, and triggers to automate critical library operations.

Operational Excellence: Demonstrated skills in database security, user management, and performance tuning.

Assignment Breakdown & Deliverables
The project was structured into five distinct parts, each addressing a critical aspect of database development.

Part 1: Foundational Setup (15 Marks)

‚úÖ Schema Definition: Created all necessary tables (BOOKS, MEMBERS, TRANSACTIONS) with appropriate constraints.

‚úÖ Data Population: Inserted initial datasets, including 20 books, 15 members, and 25 transactions, to simulate real-world scenarios.

Part 2: Essential SQL Operations (20 Marks)

‚úÖ Data Insights: Developed queries to identify available books (those with copies lent out), members with overdue items, the top 5 most borrowed books, and members with a history of late returns.

‚úÖ Data Management: Implemented data manipulation scripts for updating overdue fines, securely adding new members (preventing duplicates), and archiving historical transaction data.

Part 3: Sophisticated Querying (25 Marks)

‚úÖ Inter-Table Queries: Utilized various JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, SELF, CROSS) for comprehensive data linking and reporting.

‚úÖ Nested Queries: Employed subqueries to answer complex questions, such as identifying books borrowed above the average rate or members with higher-than-average fines for their membership type.

‚úÖ Analytical Functions: Applied aggregate and window functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, RANK, LAG) for running totals, intra-group rankings, and trend analysis.

Part 4: Automated Business Logic (25 Marks)

‚úÖ Book Issuing Automation: Created an ISSUE_BOOK stored procedure for streamlined book lending with built-in validation and error handling.

‚úÖ Fine Calculation Engine: Developed a CALCULATE_FINE function to precisely determine overdue charges.

‚úÖ Inventory Synchronization: Implemented an UPDATE_AVAILABLE_COPIES trigger to automatically adjust book availability upon return.

Part 5: Database Governance (15 Marks)

‚úÖ Access Control: Established distinct user roles (librarian, student_user) with defined privileges.

‚úÖ Performance Enhancement: Applied indexing strategies and analyzed execution plans to optimize query performance.

Core System Capabilities
The developed system boasts a range of features designed for efficient library management:

1. Robust Data Management
üìö Book Inventory:
Detailed tracking of book attributes (title, author, publisher, ISBN).

Categorization and real-time inventory counts (total vs. available copies).

üë• Member Directory:
Comprehensive member profiles, including contact information.

Support for different membership types (students, faculty, staff).

üìù Transaction Records:
Logging of all borrowing and return operations.

Automated tracking of issue, due, and return dates, along with fine status.

2. Sophisticated Data Analysis
Retrieval for Operations & Reporting:
Instant visibility into current book availability.

Identification of overdue items and their respective members.

Insights into popular books via borrowing frequency.

Detailed member activity reports.

Dynamic Data Modification:
Automatic calculation and update of overdue fines.

Secure and validated new member registration.

Archiving of older, completed transaction data to maintain performance.

Data Relationship Exploration:
INNER JOIN: For combined data from active transactions involving members and books.

LEFT JOIN: To list all books, even those without a borrowing history.

SELF JOIN: Useful for identifying members with shared borrowing interests (e.g., same categories).

CROSS JOIN: For generating all possible member-book pairings, aiding in recommendation system development.

Targeted Data Selection (Subqueries):
Identifying top-performing items or members based on specific metrics.

Analyzing usage patterns and identifying outliers (ee.g., high-fine users, least borrowed books).

Trend & Statistical Analysis (Aggregate & Window Functions):
Aggregate Functions: SUM, COUNT, AVG for overall statistics.

Window Functions: RANK(), LAG() for analyzing trends over time and ranking within groups.

3. Automated Processes with PL/SQL
üìö ISSUE_BOOK Procedure:
Streamlined book lending with checks for book availability.

Automatic generation of new transaction records.

Real-time decrement of available book copies.

Robust error handling for seamless operations.

üí∞ CALCULATE_FINE Function:
Precise calculation of fines based on overdue days.

Accepts a transaction ID and applies a daily rate (‚Çπ5).

üîÑ UPDATE_AVAILABLE_COPIES Trigger:
Automatically updates the book inventory when a book's status changes to 'Returned'.

Ensures consistent and accurate stock counts.

4. Database Administration & Optimization
üîê Security & Access Control:
Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

librarian role: Granted full administrative privileges across the system.

student_user role: Limited to read-only access on the BOOKS table for inquiries.

Comprehensive privilege management to enforce security policies.

‚ö° Performance Enhancement:
Strategic creation of indexes on frequently queried columns.

Analysis of query execution plans to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

Recommendations for further database monitoring and optimization.

Project Structure
The project files are organized for clarity and ease of execution.

Getting Started
To set up and run the system:

Establish Database Connection:
Connect to your Oracle Database instance using SQL*Plus or a similar client:

sqlplus username/password@database

Execute Scripts in Sequence:
Run the SQL files in the following order to ensure proper setup:

@sql/setup.sql    -- Initializes tables and populates data
@sql/queries.sql  -- Executes all predefined queries
@sql/plsql.sql    -- Deploys procedures, functions, and triggers
@sql/admin.sql    -- Configures user roles and performance indexes

Database Schema Overview
The system comprises three primary tables:

BOOKS: Manages the library's inventory, storing details like book_id, title, author, publisher, publication_year, isbn, category, total_copies, available_copies, and price.

MEMBERS: Contains information about library users, including member_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, address, membership_date, and membership_type.

TRANSACTIONS: Records lending and return activities with transaction_id, member_id, book_id, issue_date, due_date, return_date, fine_amount, and status.

Assignment Implementation Highlights
